// ATX is a text-based (TOML) container that bundles a list of existing texture files
// (.tga/.dds/.vbm/etc.) into a single virtual bitmap addressable as "<name>.atx".
// Frames share width/height/format with frame[0]; the loader validates this.
// The handle used by events is the .atx filename without its extension.

// Called from bm_read_header_hook when an .atx file should be loaded for the requested name.
// The `atx_filename` argument is the resolved .atx filename (e.g. "mytexture.atx"), regardless
// of which extension the caller originally requested.
