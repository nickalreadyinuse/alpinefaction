Compatibility
-------------
Alpine Faction is directly compatible only with Red Faction 1.20 North America (retail).

If you have another official distribution, Alpine Faction will attempt to apply the patches required:
* For 1.00 or 1.10 NA, the installer will apply the 1.20 official patch.
* For other retail localizations (French/German), the installer will patch your game executable as needed and maintain your localization.
* For digital distributions (Steam, GoG, etc.), the installer will patch your game executable as needed.

If you are somehow using an unsupported game executable, the installer and launcher will prompt you to obtain the correct one when you try to launch the game.

In order to fully support current features and enable future expansion, Alpine Faction uses its own unique file for storing player settings (`alpine_settings.ini`)

When you first launch Alpine, if you have a legacy player settings file (`players.cfg`) from any other Red Faction client, Alpine Faction will import those settings for you automatically.

Usage
-----
1. Install with the installer. Note that Alpine Faction does NOT have to be installed to your Red Faction folder.

2. Run `AlpineFactionLauncher.exe`.

3. Click the gear icon (next to "Play") to adjust options as desired.

4. Click the "Play" button to start playing.

Advanced usage
--------------
Alpine Faction adds many new console commands, command line options, and dedicated server configuration settings. You can find full documentation on the RF Wiki:

* https://www.redfactionwiki.com/wiki/Red_Faction_Command_Line_Parameters#Alpine_Faction
* https://www.redfactionwiki.com/wiki/Alpine_Faction_Dedicated_Server_Config

NOTE: To use Red Faction or RED command line options with Alpine Faction, use them with `AlpineFactionLauncher.exe`. They will be forwarded to the launched process.

Alpine Faction also adds many new features for level designers and mod developers. You can find full documentation on the RF Wiki:

Problems
--------
If your antivirus software detects Alpine Faction as malicious, you may need to explicitly allow it to run.
While Alpine Faction is safe to use, many antivirus vendors wrongfully flag new programs as malicious/suspicious.
If you do not trust officially provided Alpine Faction distributions, you can review the code and compile it yourself.

If you run into any problems or have questions, please ask in the Faction Files Discord server: https://discord.gg/factionfiles
